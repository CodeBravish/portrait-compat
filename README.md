# Portrait Compat

I have a virtical monitor and the support it has for alot of websites suck which is weird because the aspect ratio of a portrait monitor is similar to a phone, what's up with that mobile first development or whatever?

Portrait Compat is a browser extension that gives portrait friendly compatibility to various popular websites, I will ofcourse implement adjustments to websites I use but I do hope to fix websites outside of that few as well.

## Examples
<div style="display: flex; max-height: 50rem">
    <div style="padding-right: 1.5rem;">
        <h3>With Portrait Compat</h3>
