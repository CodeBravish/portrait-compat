# Portrait Compat

I have a vertical monitor and the support it has for a lot of websites suck which is weird because the aspect ratio of a portrait monitor is similar to a phone, what's up with that mobile first development or whatever?

Portrait Compat is a browser extension that gives portrait-friendly compatibility to various popular websites, I will of course implement adjustments to websites I use but I do hope to fix websites outside of that few as well.
